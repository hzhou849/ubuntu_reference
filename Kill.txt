if infinite loop or background app is running in background, you can 
1) run ps -eaf to get the process ID PPID (PID did not work) of the task you want to kill

2) run "kill -9 <PPID> 


method 2 - better way

Test case: 'sleep 100 &'
type 'jobs' in console and kill that job
use 'kill %1' command to terminate it
tested with while loop in terminal.
