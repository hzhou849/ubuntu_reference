tar -cvzf may_arch.tar.gz my_folder
where

-c means "create"
-v means "verbose" (sometimes bothersome and slowing down...)
-z means "use (GNU)zip"
-f XYZ declares the name of the output file. (You should chose a helping name like XYZ.tar.gz)
There may also be .tar.bz2 endings. This is the product of the -j parameter instead of the -z parameter: you will choose compression with BZIP2 (-> man bzip2).

To extract you simply use -x (eXtract) instead of -c (Create):

tar -xvzf may_arch.tar.gz
