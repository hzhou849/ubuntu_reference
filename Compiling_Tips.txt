Notes on compiling for QNX or C in general

1. Check the library header files to make sure they are linked properly.
2. *important, this has been the cause of why some of my compiles could not find references.
	Check to see if additional QNX library(binaries) needed to be added in the 'common.mk' make files
   ie LIBS += -lm (to import the lmath.so library binary on compile time) or -lsocket for socketio.h

3. Check to see if the function being called/used is actually part of the library header file.

4. also if references cannot be seen another thing to check spacing on include statements '#  include" spaces and order of placement
   may mess up compile. 

5. If datatype is type 'SOCKET' this is a windows data type. change to 'int' for linux
